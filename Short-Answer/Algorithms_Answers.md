## Exercise I

a) O(n) because as n grows it takes up more space and run time


b) O(n log n) 

The space used or the runtime will increase as we add more. The solution works for larger numbers but doesn't break so it isn't polynomial.

the first loop makes is O(n)
the second loop is less than O(n)
together they make the func O(n log n)


c) O(n)
Since it is counting the bunnies one at a time, the more we increase n the more times the loop needs to run, it grows steadily as n grows. for each increase of n the loop runs again. This represents a linear run time.
